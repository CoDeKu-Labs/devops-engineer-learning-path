# Components of a Computer

## 1. Central Processing Unit (CPU)

- The brain of the computer

- The core component of a computer responsible for executing instructions, performing calculations, and managing data flow within the system.

- Includes registers, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and control circuits, which interpret and execute assembly language instructions.

- The microprocessor is the physical hardware implementation of the CPU.

### Sub Components of the CPU

#### Registers

- Small (typically measured in bits or bytes) and high-speed storage locations inside the CPU.
- Accessed and modified directly by the CPU throughout execution.
- Temporarily holds information, commands, addresses, and intermediate processing results that the CPU is currently processing.

#### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

- Consists of electrical circuitry that performs any arithmetic and logical processes on the supplied data by the CPU.
- **Arithmetic Unit** and **Logic Unit** are the main parts.
- Registers are used to retain the data being processed.

#### Control Unit

- Aims to arrange data and instruction processing.
- Collaborates with the computer’s input and output devices.
- Instructs the computer to execute stored program instructions via communication with the ALU and registers. 

## 2. Memory

Enables the storage and retrieval of data and instructions required for processing.

### Types of Memory

1. **Primary Memory**
   - Known as main or semiconductor memory.
   - CPU has direct access to it.
   - Stores data and instructions temporarily while tasks are being executed.
   - **RAM** (Random Access Memory) and **ROM** (Read-Only Memory) are the two types of primary memory.

   #### RAM (Random Access Memory)
   - Volatile memory: data is lost if the power supply is interrupted.
   - Temporarily stores data/programs for execution.
   - Types:
     - **S RAM** (Static RAM): Uses transistors and flip-flops, retains state with power, faster access.
     - **D RAM** (Dynamic RAM): Uses capacitors and transistors, requires periodic refreshing, slower than S RAM.

   #### ROM (Read-Only Memory)
   - Non-volatile memory: retains information even without power.
   - Stores operational system information.
   - Types:
     - **MROM**: Hard-wired, pre-programmed, non-modifiable.
     - **PROM**: Programmable once, non-erasable.
     - **EPROM**: Erasable via UV light, reprogrammable.
     - **EEPROM**: Electrically erasable, reprogrammable up to 10,000 times.

2. **Secondary Memory**
   - Known as auxiliary or backup memory.
   - Non-volatile, used for large data storage.
   - Slower than the primary memory but have higher storage capacity and reusability.
   - CPU requires data transfer to primary memory for access.

3. **Cache Memory**
   - A small-sized, high-speed memory located close to the CPU or integrated within it. 
   - Semiconductor memory and CPU has direct access.
   - Temporarily stores frequently accessed data and instructions, significantly reducing the time the CPU requires to fetch information from main memory (RAM). 
   - Enhances system performance by reducing retrieval time.

## 3. Storage Devices

Devices for long-term storage of data, programs, and files.

### Categories

1. **Magnetic Tapes**
   - Magnetic tape is a plastic film with a magnetic coating, used to record data in the form of magnetic patches called records.
   - It stores data in sequential order along tracks, with each track having its own read/write head for data operations.
   - The tape can be rewound, moved forward or backward, and is commonly used for backups and archival storage due to its low cost and high capacity.

1. **Magnetic Disks**
   - Magnetic disks are circular plates coated with magnetic material, used to store data in locations called tracks arranged in concentric rings.
   - Tracks are further divided into sectors, enabling random access to data for faster retrieval compared to tapes.
   - **Hard Disk Drives (HDDs):** HDDs are a common type of magnetic disk permanently installed in computers. They offer large storage capacities, reliability, and cost-effectiveness for everyday use.

2. **Optical Disks**
   - Optical disks use laser technology to write and read data, providing affordable and long-lasting storage.
   - **CD-ROM:** Compact disks with a capacity of 600 MB; data is written using a laser to create pits on its reflective aluminum surface, allowing only reading.
   - **WORM (Write Once Read Many):** Disks where data can only be written once but read multiple times, ideal for archival purposes; cannot modify existing data.
   - **DVDs:** Digital versatile discs with variants like writable (DVD-R), rewritable (DVD-RW), and read-only (DVD-ROM). DVDs offer higher capacities ranging from 4.7 GB to 17 GB and are used for multimedia and data storage

3. **Solid-State Storage**
   - Solid-state storage uses flash memory to store data electronically, eliminating the need for moving parts and ensuring durability and reliability.
   - It provides faster data access speeds and reduced latency compared to magnetic and optical storage devices.
   - Solid-State Drives (SSDs): SSDs are storage devices that offer high-speed performance, energy efficiency, and low latency. They are faster, more durable, and more reliable than HDDs but typically come at a higher cost.

## 4. Input Devices

Hardware components for sending data and instructions to a computer system for processing and execution.

### Types of Input Devices

- **Keyboard Devices**: Text, numbers, and commands.
- **Pointing Devices**: Mouse, touchpad, trackball.
- **Composite Devices**: Touchscreen, graphics tablets.
- **Game Controllers**: Gamepads, joysticks.
- **Visual Devices**: Webcams, scanners.
- **Audio Input Devices**: Microphones, MIDI controllers.

## 5. Output Devices

Devices that receive data from a computer and convert it to usable formats, such as visual, audio, or physical output..

### Common Output Devices

- **Monitor**: Displays text, images, and videos.
- **Television**: Audio and video output.
- **Printer**: Converts digital documents to physical copies.
- **Speakers**: Converts digital signals to sound.
- **Projector**: Displays content on large screens.
- **GPS**: Provides real-time location data.
- **Video Card**: Enhances graphical performance.

## 6. Motherboard

- Connects and facilitates communication between CPU, RAM, storage, and peripherals.
- Includes chipsets for data management.
- Provides slots for component upgrades.
